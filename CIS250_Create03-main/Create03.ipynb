This is because an individual product can be part of many orders, and an order can be made of many products. For example, Order #31 may contain products 1 and 6. At first this looks like a one-to-many relationship, however, Order # 41 contains products 6 and 8. We have multiple products appearing in different orders, which makes this a many-to-many relationship. To resolve this, we use a junction table. This junctino table, _OrderItems_, lists the OrderID and each associated ProductID in their own row so that we can query them. If we run the below code cells (2) we can see that there are no fields that we can use to join Prducts and Orders.
